Given an array of N positive integers where all numbers occur even number of times except one number which occurs odd number of times. Find the exceptional number.

Example 1:

Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 3] 
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 occurs three times.
Example 2:

Input: arr = [5, 7, 2, 7, 5, 2, 5] 
Output: 5
Explanation: 
Constraints:

1 ≤ N ≤

//Code:

class Solution {
public:
	int getOddOccurrence(vector<int>& arr) {
		int ans = 0;
        for(auto a: arr) ans^=a;
        return ans;
	}
};
