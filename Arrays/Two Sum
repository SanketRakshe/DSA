/*
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
 

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.
 

Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time complexity?

        /*
        //Brute Force

            for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if(i == j) continue;
                int sum = nums[i] + nums[j];
                if(sum == target) {

        // x = target - nums[i]
        // Check that x present in your map or not if it is present then the current index and x's index are your required indexes..

            mapp[num] = i;

        return {-1, -1};
        //Wrapping this solution with the T.C = O(N) for the traversal of entire array and serching of map takes O(1) then we'll ending on this O(N)
        //S.C = O(N) this space are required for the unordered mapp




        //We can Optimized the space complexity further using two pointers but that approach we have to sort the array and hense the entire order get changed then required indexes has been changed thats why we are ending up this solution on O(N)TC and O(N)SC..
